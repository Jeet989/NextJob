This is a group submission to meet the requirements of D3. As a team of 6, we have developed an innovative job search web application called “Next Job” which aims to revolutionize the recruitment landscape by addressing the prevalent challenges in job seeking and job hiring process. It can be claimed as a one-stop solution for job seekers and employers with a goal to bridge the gap between them through user-centric interface and experience. This submission has the complete end to end feature implementation of our project prototype. In this submission data is not hardcoded and is being retrieved by calling the APIs that we have developed.

From our application’s user personas, we have collected and addressed a few frustrations.
The complexities in the process of using the application are addressed by our simple and minimalistic user interface and by implementing automated capabilities wherever possible. We have provided better user experience by eliminating time consumption problems through filters and visual analytics dashboard.

With respect to process, we have followed design thinking strategy where we started from empathize phase followed by define phase, then ideate phase, prototype phase and then finally the testing phase. With respect to tech-stack, we have used next.js for a uniform and sleek user experience, constructed RESTful APIs using Gin Web framework written in Golang for our middleware and we used MongoDB to store data in a schema less structure.
